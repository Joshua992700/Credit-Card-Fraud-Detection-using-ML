# 💫 About Me:
I am Student at Erode Sengunthar Engineering College pursuing my bachelors degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

# 💫 About the Project:
I will create a model for credit card fraud detection using machine learning predictive model Autoencoder and python.
The data set I am going to use contains data about credit card transactions that occurred during a period of two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

All variables in the data set are numerical. The data has been transformed using PCA transformation(s) due to privacy reasons.

The two features that haven’t been changed are Time and Amount. Time contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the data set.
